 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arlyn.
 I am an enthusiastic learner in the field of programming, with a strong foundation in C and C++. I have actively explored programming concepts from the basics to advanced topics including polymorphism.
 I have gained hands-on experience in implementing data structures like stacks and queues, applying them in arrays and linked lists. In addition to my programming journey, I am eager to explore and enhance
 my skills in simulating breadboard circuits using online platforms such as TINA, Tinkercad, and EasyEDA. This allows me to experiment and 
 learn in a virtual environment before implementing real-time projects.

 Furthermore, I am a dedicated leaner in the realm of device configuration and troubleshooting using Cisco Packet Tracer. I have successfully completed various tasks, including determining MAC addresses,
 identifying and working with PC NICs, building peer to peer networks, configuring IPv4 and IPv6 addresses ,and connecting wireless clients. My learning extends toconfiguring basic settings on wireless routers
 and verifying configurations using Command Prompt.

 Additionally, I am actively exploring circuit design, experimenting with various ICs to create functional circuits. My journey as a learner combines programming curiosity, hands-on experience with breadboard
 simulations, and an eagerness to explore practical networking skills using Cisco Packet Tracer. I am passionate about continuous learning, making me adaptable and ready to tackle challenges in software 
 development and network administration.

- Iâ€™m currently studying at Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology.
- Learning more about and studying: C & C++ programming languange, Configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer and Breadboarding.
